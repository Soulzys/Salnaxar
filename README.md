This is a multiplayer RFPS project (Real First Person Shooter). It is a work in progress and should ***absolutely not*** be modified in any way.  

The project makes use of Stream Services and is eventually supposed to be played with a maximum amount of 18 players. 

It is currently played as a Third Person game for testing purposes. However, it will soon be switched to a RFPS mode, when work on the environment will be the new focus of the project. 

## Notes

You cannot open the door if you are equiped with a weapon.
